Torino is a toy programming language that I am implementing as a learning
exercise. It is in the same spirit as my earlier language Scam [1], but
unlike Scam, it has a more readable C-like syntax, uses a more efficient
bytecode interpreter, and is written in Go rather than C.

Heavily inspired by Thorsten Bell's "Writing an Interpreter in Go"
series, [2] as well as Max Bernstein's blog post on bytecode
compilers and interpreters. [3]
